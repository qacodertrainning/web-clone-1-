Adds lots of advanced options to control how you display the price for your WooCommerce variable products.

== Description ==

**Variation Price Display Range for WooCommerce** plugin lets you change the price format displayed on both the shop and single product pages for WooCommerce variable products.

By default, WooCommerce displays a price range from the lowest to the highest price. The price range looks like this:- $49 - $99 under the product title. To be fair, this can create confusion.

Displaying the default WooCommerce variable product price range can lead your customers to ponder which amount they will pay. Fortunately, you can change the price range for variable products with this WooCommerce extension.

**Variation Price Display Range for WooCommerce** comes with multiple price formats. With this WooCommerce plugin, you can display the lowest variation price replacing the default price range. Once you install and activate the plugin, the price will change to the lowest price. On top of that, the string **"From"** will be added before the price.

Instead of showing the default price range **($49 - $99)**, you can choose to show **“From $49”**, or **“Upto $99”**. Additionally, there are two more price formats to choose from.

WooCommerce Variation Price Display Range plugin helps you display the variable products in a friendlier way. You will love the price formats and other well thought options of this WooCommerce show lowest variation price plugin.

=== Excellent Features of this plugin ===

🥳 **Different variation price display formats**
The Variation Price Display plugin lets WooCommece store owners complete flexibility in displaying variable prices. 

🥳 **Display Highest or Maximum price**
You might want to display the maximum price instead of a price range. This plugin lets you display only the highest or maximum price for variable products.

🥳 **Display Lowest or Minimum Price**
This plugin also lets you show only the cheapest or lowest price in WooCommerce variable products, which means you can avoid the price separator.

🥳 **Show Maximum to Minimum Price**
Sometimes, the lowest price could be a sample price rather than the actual price. You can use this plugin to show the maximum to the minimum price in that scenario.

🥳 **Show Minimum to Maximum Price**
It's a default feature of WooCommece. Still, we have included it in our plugin settings so that you do not have to face any difficulty finding this feature.

🥳 **Show “From” before the minimum price**
Instead of the default price range separator, you can use wording like 'From $49'. Your customers will get a clear view of the product from it.

🥳 **Show “Up To” before the maximum price.**
This plugin can show the price, indicating that lower price options are also available. For example, you can show it as ‘Up to $99’. 

🥳 **Change price by selecting variation from the dropdown**
Instead of displaying a barely visible price somewhere below the description, it's better to update the main price with the selected variation’s price.

🥳 **Hide default variation price**
By default, WooCommerce displays product variation prices in a separator that lists the lowest to the highest price. However, the plugin lets you choose from different options. 

🥳 **Remove clear link**
WooCommerce Product Range Display plugin lets you hide or remove the clear link when you select a variation. Incase you want to show the clear button, you'll find the option on the plugin settings.

🥳 **Format Sale Price**
Display crossed regular pice beside the sale price. Attract your customer and let them know about this on-sale product.
